Sqlite CRUD in python
Sqlite4.py
This code defines four buttons for the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete), as well as buttons and entry fields for select and logical operations. The tkinter interface is then set up with labels and entry fields for each item, and the buttons and entry fields for select and logical operations are placed on the interface as well. Finally, the interface is run and the database connection is closed when the interface is closed.

Note that if you want to run this code, you will need to have a database file called "items.db" in the same directory as the Python script. You can create this file using the code at the beginning of the script, which creates a table called "items" and inserts some sample data.
